## Controlling DLNA/UPnP devices

### Media servers, receivers and UPnP lighting

HomeGenie also has built-in UPnP/DLNA support and act as a
Media Controller to script and control your media devices
and UPnP lighting. 
Sharing your media from room to room and from device to device has never been easier.
From *Configure->Groups* and Modules section we can add to the control page our media
devices by selecting the Add Module option from the Actions menu.

Then we will be able to browse Media Servers from the control page (either from the
web interface or the mobile client) and send pictures, videos and music to any Media Receiver.

By adding Media Receivers to the control page, we'll also be able to control them.
