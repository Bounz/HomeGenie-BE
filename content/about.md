## Why HomeGenie?

We can see bunch of new smart devices brought to the market day by day,
each of them implementing proprietary protocols and applications.
So, dealing with smart devices it often means dealing with
different applications, making home automation not that effective.

This is why *HomeGenie* server was specifically designed to find a
reasonable way of integrating current and future home automation
technologies into one single piece of software.
